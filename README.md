# Just try to end each year happily

I started during the pandemic year (2020) and I really enjoyed
the exercises and the time trying it.
I am going to use it as an excuse for learning new programming
languages and, on the go, try to have some fun with other geek friends.

- 2020 edition
  - Mostly Golang (I tried also rust but it didn't fly much)
- 2021 edition
  - I'm tring it in Swift, let's give Apple languages a try
- 2022 edition
  - Let's do it in Rust (I really was expecting this...)
- 2023 edition
  - Coming back to the origins... C++ it is
- 2024 edition
  - Let's do it in Python (Try the Machine Learning language and learn something)
- 2025 edition
  - Exploring Typescript and what it can do better or worse compared to Javascript
  
  **Initial Setup:**
  ```bash
  cd 2025
  npm install
  ```
  
  **Daily Usage:**
  - Files: `day1.ts`, `day1p2.ts`, etc. in `/2025` folder
  - Input: `input.txt` in same folder as solution
  - Run: Press **F5** in VS Code or `npx ts-node dayX.ts`
  - Template:
    ```typescript
    import { readInput } from './utils';
    
    const lines = readInput();
    // Your solution here
    ```
