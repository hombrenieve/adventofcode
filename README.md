# Just try to end each year happily

I started during the pandemic year (2020) and I really enjoyed
the exercises and the time trying it.
I am going to use it as an excuse for learning new programming
languages and, on the go, try to have some fun with other geek friends.

- 2020 edition
  - Mostly Golang (I tried also rust but it didn't fly much)
- 2021 edition
  - I'm tring it in Swift, let's give Apple languages a try
- 2022 edition
  - Let's do it in Rust (I really was expecting this...)
- 2023 edition
  - Coming back to the origins... C++ it is
